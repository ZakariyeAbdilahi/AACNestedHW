# Mini-Project 5: Augmentive and Alternative Communication Devices

## Overview
This project involves building a sample Augmentive and Alternative Communication (AAC) system using an extended version of the AssociativeArray class in Java. The goal is to implement functionalities for AAC categories and mappings, allowing users to navigate and communicate using images and text.

## Project Structure
- **Structures Package**: Contains the `AssociativeArray` class along with `KVPair` class.
- **AACCategory Class**: Defines methods for managing 'AAC categories', including mapping image locations to words.
- **AACMappings Class**: Implements functionalities for managing mappings between filenames and words, using `AACCategory` objects.

## Usage
1. **Running the Application**: Run the application to interact with the AAC system.
2. **Navigating Categories**: Use the implemented functionalities to navigate AAC categories.
3. **Communicating**: Utilize the system to communicate using images and text.

## Notes
- The application may take some time to load due to its complexity.
